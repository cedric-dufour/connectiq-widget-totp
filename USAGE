Security
--------

First of all, as soon as an unauthorized party gets hold of your device, TOTP
codes are readily available as long as the device work.

Besides that, TOTP secret keys, along other accounts parameters, are stored in
Connect IQ's App.Storage. Given users are never asked for a password to unlock
any encryption that may - or may not - exist on Garmin devices, data in the
App.Storage are - ultimately - vulnerable to unauthorized access/recovery, even
if the App.Storage appears to be "mangled" in some sort.

Bottom-line...

IF YOUR DEVICE IS STOLEN, LOST OR JUST THROWN AWAY, CONSIDER YOUR TOTP TOKEN(S)
COMPROMISED AND PROCEED TO REPLACE THEM (USING EACH ACCOUNT'S AD-HOC PROCEDURE).

If you plan to dispose of your device, the only guaranteed way of making sure
the App.Storage data - and TOTP secret keys - are not recoverable is to destroy
the device (memory)! Factory-resetting the device does NOT suffice!
